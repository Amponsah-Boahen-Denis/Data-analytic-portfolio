Project title: SALES DATA ANALYSIS.

Project goal: Analyze sales data to identify trends, top-selling products, and revenue metrics for business decision-making.

Tools used: Excel and Power BI

Dataset: 185,951 rows and 10 columns.

Tasks done by Excel on this project:
1.Generated the profit column by subtracting the price of each product from their sales.
2.Separated the time from the date, which was combined in the same column, into a different column.
3.Duplicate records were checked
4.Data was converted to a suitable table form by excel before analysis.

Tasks done by Power BI:
1.Visualizations
2.KPI (Key Performance Indicator)
Analysis of the project:

KPIs: Total profit, Total price for each product, Total quantity ordered, and Total sales.

1.The first four products with higher sales are: Macbook Pro Laptop, iPhone, Thinkpad Laptop, and Google Phone.
2.The last four products with lower sales are: AAA Batteries, Wired Headphones, USB Charging Cable, and Lightning Charging Cable.
3.Sales started increasing from September to December in the year.

Suggestions:
I think products with low sales should be advertised to the media or nearby customers. This could help attract more customers for those products. 
Additionally, importing more diverse products into the company could increase overall revenue.

PLEASE YOUR IDEAS AND SUGESTIONS ARE WELCOME.
THANK YOU MeriSKILL.

            This is another Excel project I worked on, and it's all about a dashboard for a Beverage Brand.
             From the dashboard I created, I realized that Coca Cola is the most distributed brand across all 
             customers compared to any other beverage brand. On the other hand, Sprite has low sales because customers are not demanding it like they do with Coca Cola, resulting in low income for the company. However, the performance of the other brands is not bad at all. I used Excel for organizing 
            the data and Excel for visualization."
            </p>
            <h4>conclusion</h4>
            <p class="p">
              I would like to conclude by suggesting that they should focus on increasing profitability
              from the Sprite brand to improve their overall revenue. Additionally, they could consider 
              adding more beverage brands to their menu to diversify and enhance their
               offerings, which may lead to further improvements."

   This is a shipping products dashboard I created with the Power BI tool and Excel 
   for data cleansing. From the dashboard, what I observed is that some of the shipping projects 
   have been shipped to many countries and different customers, while others are not performing well. This could be due to the scarcity of the products or a small number of customers for such products across the geography. Additionally, 
  the higher the number of customers for a particular product, the higher the profit they generate, and vice versa
  </p>
  <h4>conclusion</h4>
  <p class="p">
    I believe that in order to increase their profit from these products, 
    they should create more inventory of the scarce items and actively seek out 
    additional customers for such projects

      .This is the Cookies distribution dashboard of a 
      company that I created. I used Power BI for data cleaning and visualization. 
      One of the key observations from this project is that the company faces significant delays in distributing cookies to their customers, which can be identified by checking the date difference between the order date and the delivery date. As a result, certain types of cookies are not frequently distributed to their customers.
  
      In the year 2017, the company experienced a significant increase in profit due to a growing number of customers."
      </p>
      <h4>conclusion</h4>
      <p class="p">
        I will conclude by suggesting that the company should make efforts to 
        deliver the cookies on time. They could consider hiring more people to ensure
         timely deliveries. Additionally, it would be beneficial for them to expand their advertising
          efforts and target more restaurants to attract
         a larger customer base for their cookies
